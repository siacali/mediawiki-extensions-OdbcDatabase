information.

== Overview ==

The OdbcDatabase extension allows access to data sources using the
PHP ODBC functions (e.g. odbc_connect). The extenion provides
only basic data acquisition capability and is NOT suitable for
the primary database behind MediaWiki.

In particular, this extension was written to provide access to
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 from a RHEL 5 server running MediaWiki
1.20.2 and PHP 5.3.3. It has not yet been tested with any other
configurations.

== Usage ==

See the extenion's home page for more details.
